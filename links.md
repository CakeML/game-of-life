Other target technologies
-------------------------

Here are some projects doing digital design on top of technology not primarily designed for digital design:

 - [What Makes Mario NP-Hard?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS8m9fSk-Wk) -- circuit-like constructs on top of Mario. Video based on [Classic Nintendo games are (computationally) hard](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895).
 - [Can we compile C code into PowerPoint?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LArkm4v5mWA) -- the title explains it all
 - Of course, sandbox games like Minecraft allow you to implement circuits as well
 - (Less relevant: [One can implement the Rule 110 cellular automaton on top of CSS to show that CSS is Turing complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete).)
